### Acceptance Criteria

* WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents

## How to use it

Run in the terminal "mysql -u root" to connect the mysql. Run the command "source db/schema.sql" to create the ecommerce_db database. Exit mysql and run in the terminal "node seeds/index.js" to insert the data into the database. Once this is done, run node server and open Insomnia to test each route.
